# Analyzing Ultimate Frisbee Statistics 

## GOAL OF THE PROJECT: 

The goal of this project is to submit raw Ultimate Frisbee data to the Wolfram Data Repository and also analyze different Ultimate Frisbee statistics. The plots shown above show the best comparison for all players from teams that were a part of the AUDL 2017 season. 

## SUMMARY OF WORK: 

1.  Practiced visualization and curating data into a dataset by using raw data from the paper titled Spatial Statistics to Evaluate Player Contribution in Ultimate written by Jeremy C. Weiss, Sean Childers.

2. Submitted raw Ultimate Frisbee data from the source UltiAnalytics to the Wolfram Data Repository.

3. Visualized various statistics from UltiAnalytics; specifically comparing stats from the AUDL teams from the 2017 season.

4. Practiced creating graphics to show how Ultimate Frisbee is played and to help explain the game concept. 

## RESULTS AND FUTURE  WORK:

Create a microsite that visualizes team statistics, submit additional raw Ultimate Frisbee data, create simulation of throwing the disc and create simulation of an actual game.

# About Ultimate Frisbee

As defined by USA Ultimate, combining the non-stop movement and athletic endurance of soccer with the aerial passing skills of football, a game of ultimate is played by two teams with a flying disc on a field with end zones, similar to football. The object of the game is to score by catching a pass in the opponent's end zone. A player must stop running while in possession of the disc, but may pivot and pass to any of the other receivers on the field. Ultimate is a transition game in which players move quickly from offense to defense on turnovers that occur with a dropped pass, an interception, a pass out of bounds, or when a player is caught holding the disc for more than ten seconds. Ultimate is governed by Spirit of the Game\[Trademark], a tradition of sportsmanship that places the responsibility for fair play on the players rather than referees.

The AUDL (American Ultimate Disc League) and MLU (Major League Ultimate) are semi-pro leagues composed of men's Ultimate Frisbee teams. The AUDL is composed of 25 teams divided into four geographic divisions. The MLU is composed of eight teams divided into two geographic division. USA Ultimate is the national governing body for ultimate in the United States. USAU runs a club series for men's teams, women's teams, and mixed gender teams, which is open to any team that wishes to participate.

## Conclusion

The main takeaway from this project was learning how to work with big datasets and learning about the data curation process. Having a passion for Ultimate Frisbee, it made curating data very enjoyable and gave me insight into the data science world. It was interesting to learn about different players and how their stats compare to each other. Analyzing the data also helped me understand how I can improve my set of Ultimate Frisbee skills and that is valuable insight one can't get anywhere else. It was also exciting to actually create and format a dataset that will eventually be able to be used by everyone.
