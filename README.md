# Final Project Prahasi Kacham

## My final project is an ultimate frisbee analysis web application. I will be analyzing ultimate frisbee stats from various USA Ultimate tournaments with hopes of coming up with a conclusion about what are the best defensive and offensive plays that can be used in a game. I will also be adding extra features like:

### simulation to show how the game is played and types of throws 
### analysis of where ultimate frisbee is most commonly played (area)
